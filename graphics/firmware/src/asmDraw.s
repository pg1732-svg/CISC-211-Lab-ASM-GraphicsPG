/********************************************************************
function name: asmDraw(downUp, rightLeft, reset)
function description:
Note: r0 and r1 are optional. The C test code uses them 
as shown below. However, your code can choose to ignore them, and update
buf0 and buf1 any way you'd like whenever asmDraw is called.
However, r2 should always reset your animation to its starting value
         
Inputs: r0: upDown:    -N: move up (towards row00) N pixels
                        0: do not move in the vertical direction
                        N: (positive number): move down (towards row19)
        r1: leftRight: -N: move left N pixels
                        0: do not move in the horizontal direction
                        N: (positive number): move right N pixels
        r2: reset:      0: do the commands specified by other input
                           parameters
                        1: ignore the other input parameters. Reset the
                           display to its original state.
 Outputs: r0: pointer to memory buffer containing updated display data

 Notes: * Do not modify the data in any of the rowA** loctions! Use
          it as your reset data, to start over when commanded.
          Use the space allocated for buf0 and buf1 to capture your
          output data. 
        * The first call to the asmDraw code will always be a reset, so that
          you can copy clean data from rowA** into an output buffer.
        * The reset should always return the address of buf0 in r0,
                 e.g.   LDR r0,=buf0
        * Each subsequent call with a valid non-reset command should return
          the address of the other buffer. This allows you to copy and
          modfiy data from the previous buffer to generate your next
          buffer. So, if the last call returned buf0, the current call 
          should return buf1. And the call after that should once again 
          return buf0.
        * You can create more bufs if you need them for some reason.
        * You should create your own mem locations to store info such
          as which buf was the last one used.
